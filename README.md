# Git Tutorial

## Join GitHub
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you should [create one](https://github.com/join) before we start.

## Instillation
First we should check if Git already installed by running the command:
```
git --version
```
If you see a version number, Git is already installed and you can skip the next steps about instillation.

### How to install:
1. Download Git from the [downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Select the default installation settings all the way through the instillation process.
3. Once complete, run the command above again to verify that Git installed successfully.
